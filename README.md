</p>

Bow and Arrow is a small _"quasi"_-remake of the John di Troia's Bow & Arrow.
You can find more info about the original game in
[Classic DOS Games](http://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Bow_and_Arrow_-_In_Search_of_the_Greatest_Archer.html)

It was developed in C# using [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/).


For a long time I forgot this project, but decided to release it now :)

As usual, you are **very welcomed** to **share** and **hack** it.

## Dedication

This game is dedicated to
[Instituto Mario Penna](http://www.mariopenna.org.br/).

Take a 5 min break, take a look their site and find a way to help them :D

Thanks! <3
